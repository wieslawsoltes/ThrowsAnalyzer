# ThrowsAnalyzer - Comprehensive Analysis and Proposed Extensions

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation - Exception Type Detection (IMPLEMENTED)

The foundation for semantic model-based exception type analysis has been fully implemented:

**Components:**
- `ExceptionTypeAnalyzer` - Core type detection infrastructure with methods:
  - `GetThrownExceptionType()` - Resolves exception types from throw statements
  - `GetCaughtExceptionType()` - Resolves exception types from catch clauses
  - `IsExceptionType()` - Validates if a type inherits from System.Exception
  - `IsAssignableTo()` - Checks type inheritance relationships
  - `GetExceptionHierarchy()` - Returns inheritance chain

- `TypedThrowDetector` - Enhanced throw detection with full type information
- `TypedThrowInfo`, `CatchClauseInfo`, `CatchClauseOrderingIssue` - Data models

**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

### ✅ Phase 2: Catch Clause Analysis (IMPLEMENTED)

Advanced catch clause analysis with semantic type information:

**Components:**
- `CatchClauseAnalyzer` - Provides:
  - `DetectOrderingIssues()` - Finds unreachable catch clauses
  - `DetectEmptyCatches()` - Finds exception swallowing patterns
  - `DetectRethrowOnlyCatches()` - Finds unnecessary catch blocks
  - `DetectOverlyBroadCatches()` - Finds overly broad exception handling

**New Analyzers:**
- `RethrowAntiPatternAnalyzer` - Reports THROWS004
- `CatchClauseOrderingAnalyzer` - Reports THROWS007, THROWS008, THROWS009, THROWS010

**New Diagnostics:**
- **THROWS004** (Warning): Rethrow anti-pattern (`throw ex;` instead of `throw;`)
- **THROWS007** (Warning): Unreachable catch clause due to ordering
- **THROWS008** (Warning): Empty catch block swallows exceptions
- **THROWS009** (Info): Catch block only rethrows exception

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Existing Detectors

#### 1. ThrowStatementDetector
**What it detects:**
- `throw` statements (`ThrowStatementSyntax`)
- `throw` expressions (`ThrowExpressionSyntax`)

**Scope:**
- Method bodies (`methodDeclaration.Body`)
- Expression-bodied methods (`methodDeclaration.ExpressionBody`)

**Limitations:**
- Only analyzes methods
- Does not distinguish between new throws vs rethrows
- Does not detect throws in other member types (properties, constructors, etc.)
- Does not analyze local functions within methods
- Does not analyze lambda expressions

#### 2. TryCatchDetector
**What it detects:**
- `try` statements (`TryStatementSyntax`)

**Scope:**
- Method bodies
- Expression-bodied methods (always returns false - cannot have try/catch)

**Limitations:**
- Does not distinguish between try-catch vs try-finally vs try-catch-finally
- Does not analyze catch clauses or exception filters (`when` clauses)
- Does not detect catch clause ordering issues
- Does not analyze finally blocks

#### 3. UnhandledThrowDetector
**What it detects:**
- Throws not wrapped in try blocks

**Logic:**
- Checks if throw is inside `tryBlock.Block` (the try body)

**Limitations:**
- Does not verify if catch clauses can actually handle the thrown exception type
- Does not consider exception type hierarchy
- Throws in catch blocks are considered "handled" but may not be
- Throws in finally blocks are not specifically analyzed
- Does not consider exception filters (`when` clauses)

### Existing Analyzers

1. **MethodThrowsAnalyzer (THROWS001)** - Detects methods with throw statements
2. **UnhandledThrowsAnalyzer (THROWS002)** - Detects methods with unhandled throws
3. **TryCatchAnalyzer (THROWS003)** - Detects methods with try/catch blocks

## C# Exception Handling - Complete Semantics

### Throw Statement Forms

1. **New exception:** `throw new Exception();`
2. **Rethrow (bare throw):** `throw;` - preserves original stack trace
3. **Throw with variable:** `throw ex;` - updates stack trace (anti-pattern)
4. **Throw expression:** Used in expression contexts:
   - Conditional operator: `value ?? throw new Exception()`
   - Null-coalescing operator: `x ?? throw new Exception()`
   - Expression-bodied members: `int Foo() => throw new Exception();`

### Try Statement Forms

1. **try-catch**: Handle exceptions
2. **try-finally**: Cleanup code that always executes
3. **try-catch-finally**: Handle exceptions with cleanup

### Catch Clause Features

1. **Specific exception type:** `catch (ArgumentException ex)`
2. **Catch without variable:** `catch (ArgumentException)`
3. **General catch:** `catch (Exception ex)` or `catch`
4. **Exception filters (when clause):** `catch (Exception ex) when (ex.Message.Contains("..."))`
5. **Catch clause ordering:** More specific exceptions must come before general ones

### Exception Flow Rules

1. **Stack unwinding**: CLR searches up the call stack for handlers
2. **Finally always executes**: Except in catastrophic failures
3. **Rethrow preserves stack**: `throw;` vs `throw ex;`
4. **Exception filters preserve stack**: Evaluated before unwinding

### Member Types That Can Throw/Handle

1. **Methods** ✓ (currently analyzed)
2. **Constructors** ✗ (not analyzed)
3. **Finalizers/Destructors** ✗ (not analyzed)
4. **Property getters/setters** ✗ (not analyzed)
5. **Indexer getters/setters** ✗ (not analyzed)
6. **Event add/remove accessors** ✗ (not analyzed)
7. **Operators** ✗ (not analyzed)
8. **Local functions** ✗ (not analyzed)
9. **Lambda expressions** ✗ (not analyzed)
10. **Anonymous methods** ✗ (not analyzed)

## Proposed Extensions

### Phase 1: Enhanced Detection (High Priority)

#### 1.1 RethrowDetector
**Purpose:** Distinguish between new throws and rethrows

**Detection:**
- `throw;` (bare rethrow - valid only in catch blocks)
- `throw ex;` (anti-pattern rethrow that modifies stack trace)

**Use cases:**
- THROWS004: Detect rethrows outside catch blocks (compile error but good to catch)
- THROWS005: Detect `throw ex;` anti-pattern (should use `throw;`)
- THROWS006: Detect catch blocks that don't rethrow or handle exceptions (swallow exceptions)

#### 1.2 CatchClauseAnalyzer
**Purpose:** Analyze catch clause structure and exception filters

**Detection:**
- Catch clauses with exception filters (`when` clause)
- Catch clause ordering (general catch before specific)
- Empty catch blocks (exception swallowing)
- Catch blocks that only rethrow
- Overly broad catches (catching `Exception` or `SystemException`)

**Use cases:**
- THROWS007: Catch clauses in wrong order
- THROWS008: Empty catch block (exception swallowing)
- THROWS009: Catch block only rethrows (unnecessary catch)
- THROWS010: Overly broad exception catch

#### 1.3 FinallyBlockDetector
**Purpose:** Detect and analyze finally blocks

**Detection:**
- Methods with finally blocks
- Throws inside finally blocks (dangerous - can mask exceptions)
- Return statements in finally blocks (anti-pattern)

**Use cases:**
- THROWS011: Throw inside finally block (masks original exception)
- THROWS012: Return in finally block (unexpected behavior)

#### 1.4 ExceptionTypeDetector
**Purpose:** Analyze exception types being thrown and caught

**Detection:**
- Extract exception type from `throw new ExceptionType()`
- Extract exception types from catch clauses
- Build exception type hierarchy awareness

**Use cases:**
- THROWS013: Throw more specific exceptions than caught
- THROWS014: Dead catch clause (previous clause catches all)

### Phase 2: Extended Member Support (Medium Priority)

#### 2.1 Multi-Member Support
**Extend all detectors to support:**

1. **BaseMethodDeclarationSyntax** (covers methods, constructors, destructors, operators)
2. **AccessorDeclarationSyntax** (property/indexer/event accessors)
3. **LocalFunctionStatementSyntax** (local functions)
4. **LambdaExpressionSyntax** (lambda expressions)
5. **AnonymousMethodExpressionSyntax** (anonymous methods)

**Refactoring approach:**
- Create generic `IExecutableDetector` interface accepting `SyntaxNode`
- Implement member-specific detection logic
- Extend `GetNodesToAnalyze` to handle all member types

**Use cases:**
- Analyze throws in constructors (common pattern)
- Analyze throws in property getters/setters
- Analyze throws in local functions
- Analyze throws in lambda expressions

#### 2.2 Constructor-Specific Analysis
**Purpose:** Special handling for constructor exceptions

**Detection:**
- Unhandled throws in constructors (usually intentional)
- Try-catch in constructors (may indicate design issues)

**Use cases:**
- THROWS015: Constructor with try-catch (consider factory pattern)
- THROWS016: Constructor throws in finally block

### Phase 3: Advanced Analysis (Low Priority)

#### 3.1 Exception Flow Analyzer
**Purpose:** Trace exception propagation through call graphs

**Detection:**
- Methods that call throwing methods
- Exception propagation chains
- Exceptions crossing assembly boundaries

**Use cases:**
- THROWS017: Method calls throwing method without handling
- THROWS018: Exception propagation across 3+ levels
- THROWS019: Public API throws undocumented exception

#### 3.2 Async Exception Detector
**Purpose:** Analyze exceptions in async/await contexts

**Detection:**
- Throws in async methods
- Awaited calls that may throw
- Task exception handling

**Use cases:**
- THROWS020: Async method throws synchronously (before first await)
- THROWS021: Unobserved task exception

#### 3.3 Iterator Exception Detector
**Purpose:** Analyze exceptions in iterator methods (yield return)

**Detection:**
- Throws in iterator methods
- Exception timing (definition vs enumeration)

**Use cases:**
- THROWS022: Exception in iterator (deferred until enumeration)
- THROWS023: Try-finally in iterator (may not execute as expected)

### Phase 4: Best Practices & Code Quality (Optional)

#### 4.1 Exception Design Patterns
**Use cases:**
- THROWS024: Consider using Result<T> pattern instead of exceptions
- THROWS025: Exception used for control flow
- THROWS026: Throwing in finalizer (dangerous)
- THROWS027: Custom exception doesn't follow naming convention (*Exception)

#### 4.2 Performance Analysis
**Use cases:**
- THROWS028: Exception in hot path (performance concern)
- THROWS029: Frequent exception creation (allocations)

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate (v1.1)
1. RethrowDetector + analyzer for `throw ex;` anti-pattern
2. CatchClauseAnalyzer for empty catch blocks and catch ordering
3. FinallyBlockDetector for throws in finally

### Short-term (v1.2)
4. ExceptionTypeDetector for type-aware analysis
5. Extend detectors to support constructors, properties, operators

### Medium-term (v2.0)
6. Local function and lambda expression support
7. Async exception analysis
8. Iterator exception analysis

### Long-term (v3.0)
9. Exception flow analysis (requires semantic model)
10. Cross-assembly exception tracking
11. Best practices and performance analysis

## Architecture Recommendations

### 1. Generic Member Support
Create a common abstraction for "executable members":

```csharp
public interface IExecutableMemberDetector
{
    bool SupportsNode(SyntaxNode node);
    IEnumerable<SyntaxNode> GetExecutableBlocks(SyntaxNode node);
}
```

### 2. Exception Type Analysis (Requires Semantic Model)
Current detectors use only syntax analysis. For exception type matching:

```csharp
public static class ExceptionTypeDetector
{
    public static ITypeSymbol? GetThrownExceptionType(
        ThrowStatementSyntax throwStatement,
        SemanticModel semanticModel)
    {
        // Analyze exception type using semantic model
    }
}
```

### 3. Composable Analysis Pipeline
Build analysis pipeline for complex scenarios:

```csharp
public static class ExceptionAnalysisPipeline
{
    public static ExceptionAnalysisResult Analyze(
        SyntaxNode node,
        params IExceptionDetector[] detectors)
    {
        // Compose multiple detectors
    }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### New Test Categories
1. **Rethrow Tests**: Bare rethrow, throw with variable, rethrow outside catch
2. **Catch Clause Tests**: Filters, ordering, empty catches, specific types
3. **Finally Tests**: Throws in finally, returns in finally
4. **Constructor Tests**: Throws in ctors, try-catch in ctors
5. **Property Tests**: Throws in getters/setters
6. **Local Function Tests**: Throws in local functions, nested local functions
7. **Lambda Tests**: Throws in lambdas, expression lambdas
8. **Async Tests**: Throws in async methods, awaited exceptions
9. **Iterator Tests**: Throws in yield methods

## Breaking Changes

### None Proposed
All extensions are additive:
- New detectors (don't modify existing)
- New analyzers with new diagnostic IDs
- Extended support for additional member types
- Backward compatible with existing code

## Summary

Current implementation covers ~30% of C# exception handling semantics:
- ✓ Basic throw detection (methods only)
- ✓ Basic try-catch detection (methods only)
- ✓ Basic unhandled throw detection (syntax-only, no type analysis)
- ✗ Rethrow detection
- ✗ Catch clause analysis (filters, ordering, empty catches)
- ✗ Finally block analysis
- ✗ Exception type analysis
- ✗ Constructors, properties, operators
- ✗ Local functions, lambdas
- ✗ Async/iterator specific analysis
- ✗ Exception flow analysis

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Implement RethrowDetector (detect `throw;` vs `throw ex;`)
2. Implement CatchClauseAnalyzer (empty catches, ordering)
3. Implement FinallyBlockDetector (throws in finally)
4. Extend to constructors and properties
5. Add semantic model support for exception type analysis
