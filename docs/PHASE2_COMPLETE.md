# Phase 2: Call Graph Infrastructure - COMPLETE

## Summary

Phase 2 has been successfully completed. This phase extracted the call graph infrastructure and created a generic flow analysis pattern that can be used for various types of flow analysis (exceptions, data, taint, nulls, etc.).

## Components Extracted

### Call Graph Infrastructure

#### `Analysis/CallGraph/CallGraph.cs`
Core data structures for representing method call relationships:
- `CallGraph` - Directed graph of method invocations
- `CallGraphNode` - Represents a method with bidirectional edges
- `CallGraphEdge` - Represents a call from one method to another

Key features:
- Bidirectional edges (tracks both callers and callees)
- Symbol equality comparison for correct Roslyn symbol handling
- Cycle detection in depth calculation
- O(1) node lookup

#### `Analysis/CallGraph/CallGraphBuilder.cs`
Builder for constructing call graphs from Roslyn compilations:

Key features:
- Full compilation analysis via `BuildAsync()`
- Single method analysis via `BuildForMethodAsync()`
- Support for:
  - Regular methods
  - Constructors (including object creation expressions)
  - Local functions
  - Expression-bodied members
- Transitive operations:
  - `GetTransitiveCallees()` - all methods called transitively
  - `GetTransitiveCallers()` - all methods that call transitively
- Cycle detection with depth limiting (prevents infinite recursion)
- CancellationToken support throughout
- ConfigureAwait(false) for all async operations

### Generic Flow Analysis Pattern

#### `Analysis/Flow/IFlowInfo.cs`
Generic interface for representing flow information:
```csharp
public interface IFlowInfo<TFlow>
{
    ISymbol Element { get; }
    IEnumerable<TFlow> IncomingFlow { get; }
    IEnumerable<TFlow> OutgoingFlow { get; }
    bool HasUnhandledFlow { get; }
}
```

Can be used for:
- Exception flow (what exceptions propagate through methods)
- Data flow (what data values flow through variables)
- Taint flow (what data is tainted/untrusted)
- Null flow (what variables may be null)

#### `Analysis/Flow/IFlowAnalyzer.cs`
Generic interface for flow analyzers:
```csharp
public interface IFlowAnalyzer<TFlow, TInfo> where TInfo : IFlowInfo<TFlow>
{
    Task<TInfo> AnalyzeAsync(IMethodSymbol method, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<IEnumerable<TInfo>> AnalyzeCompilationAsync(Compilation compilation, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    IEnumerable<TFlow> CombineFlows(params IEnumerable<TFlow>[] flows);
}
```

#### `Analysis/Flow/FlowAnalyzerBase.cs`
Abstract base class providing common infrastructure:
- Caching of analysis results (Dictionary<IMethodSymbol, TInfo>)
- Call graph integration
- Common traversal patterns
- Default union-based flow combination
- Protected methods for cache management

Derived classes only need to implement:
```csharp
protected abstract Task<TInfo> AnalyzeMethodAsync(IMethodSymbol method, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
```

## Test Coverage

### CallGraphTests.cs (16 tests)
- Node creation and retrieval
- Edge addition (single and multiple)
- Bidirectional edge tracking
- Node/edge counting
- Depth calculation (including cycles)
- Multiple paths handling

### CallGraphBuilderTests.cs (20 tests)
- Simple method calls
- Multiple method calls
- Constructor calls (object creation)
- Local functions
- Expression-bodied methods
- Single method analysis
- Cancellation token support
- Transitive callees (linear chains, cycles, depth limiting)
- Transitive callers (linear chains, cycles, depth limiting)
- Non-existent method handling

### FlowAnalyzerBaseTests.cs (14 tests)
- Analysis execution
- Caching behavior
- Compilation-wide analysis
- Cancellation token support
- Flow combination (union, duplicates, empty)
- Cache clearing
- Cache access methods

**Total: 50 new tests (80 total including Phase 1)**
**All tests passing: 80/80**

## Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Missing using directives
**Problem**: IFlowInfo.cs and IFlowAnalyzer.cs were missing `using System.Collections.Generic;`

**Fix**: Added required using directives to both files.

### Issue 2: Expression-bodied method analysis
**Problem**: CallGraphBuilder was not analyzing expression-bodied methods correctly. It was looking at `.ExpressionBody?.Expression` instead of the entire `.ExpressionBody` node.

**Fix**: Changed line 181 in CallGraphBuilder.cs:
```csharp
// Before
body = methodDeclSyntax.ExpressionBody?.Expression;

// After
body = methodDeclSyntax.ExpressionBody;
```

This allows `DescendantNodes()` to traverse the entire expression body and find invocations.
