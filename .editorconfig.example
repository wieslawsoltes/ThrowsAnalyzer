# ========================================
# Analyzer Rule Severity Configuration
# ========================================
# Control the severity of each analyzer rule
# Options: none, silent, suggestion, warning, error
# Default: warning for THROWS001 and THROWS002, info for THROWS003

# THROWS001: Detects throw statements in members
dotnet_diagnostic.THROWS001.severity = warning

# THROWS002: Detects unhandled throw statements (not wrapped in try-catch)
dotnet_diagnostic.THROWS002.severity = warning

# THROWS003: Detects try-catch blocks in members
dotnet_diagnostic.THROWS003.severity = suggestion


# ========================================
# Member Type Analysis Configuration
# ========================================
# Control which member types are analyzed
# Options: true, false
# Default: true (all member types are analyzed)

# Analyze regular methods
throws_analyzer_analyze_methods = true

# Analyze constructors
throws_analyzer_analyze_constructors = true

# Analyze destructors/finalizers

# Analyze operator overloads

# Analyze conversion operators (implicit/explicit)

# Analyze properties (expression-bodied properties)

# Analyze local functions

# Analyze lambda expressions

# Analyze anonymous methods (delegate { } syntax)

# ========================================
# Example: Minimal Configuration
# ========================================
# Uncomment to analyze only methods and constructors:
# throws_analyzer_analyze_methods = true
# throws_analyzer_analyze_constructors = true
# throws_analyzer_analyze_destructors = false
# throws_analyzer_analyze_operators = false
# throws_analyzer_analyze_conversion_operators = false

# throws_analyzer_analyze_local_functions = false
# throws_analyzer_analyze_lambdas = false
# throws_analyzer_analyze_anonymous_methods = false


# ========================================
# Example: Focus on Unhandled Exceptions
# ========================================
# Uncomment to focus only on unhandled throws:
# dotnet_diagnostic.THROWS001.severity = none
# dotnet_diagnostic.THROWS002.severity = error
# dotnet_diagnostic.THROWS003.severity = none
